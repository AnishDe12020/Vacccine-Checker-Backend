This is the backend part of a small project which will notify you if there is a vaccination slot avaiable in your pincode. The front end part of this project is hosted at [https://vaccine-checker-anishde12020.vercel.app/](https://vaccine-checker-anishde12020.vercel.app/). You can see the source code for the same in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AnishDe12020/Vaccine-Checker-Frontend)

**Note: The backend part is not hosted anywhere as of now so it won't really alert you just yet**
